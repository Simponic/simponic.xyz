* huh?
yes, i stole [[http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com][that other guy's css]].

my name is elizabeth, or lizzy / liz if you're cool. i'm 19, president
of the [[https://linux.usu.edu][USU FSLC]], senior in computer science, blah blah blah...
also a filthy liberal :)

sometimes, i make cool stuff that i'm proud of. like [[https://chessh.linux.usu.edu][cheSSH]]!

you didn't hear it here, but "swag" is one in active development. only
cool people know what it is, so keep it under wraps ðŸ¤«.

** regulars be saddened, for we are now static
i used to have a kinda cool site i built a few years back, to explore [[https://www.phoenixframework.org/][phoenix]].
but i never ended up using the features i spent so
long making - a time card clock, contact form w/ captcha, dynamic blog
system with comments and roles, etc. it was one of my first full-stack
apps i did for fun, at the time; so pulling the plug was a little bittersweet.

all you'll get here now, mostly, is black text and some of my takes.
whether they're good or bad is up to you, dear reader.

* salaries
i believe people would do good to openly share the money they make, to at
least "help" combat corporate greed.

* things i like...
+ elixir, lisp, c, (some aspects of) javascript. i don't really know how to feel about java, but i've used it the most out of anything.
+ math - algebra of abstract or linear variety, number theory, analysis, discrete. you name it. shove it in my brain already.
+ functional paradigms.
+ emacs.
+ linux.
+ chess.
+ minecraft.
+ democratic nations that practice social ideals to better the lives of its citizens rather than capital owners.
  
* things i'm not so much a fan of...
+ c++ - when it's being cringe. which is unfortunately a lot of the fucking time.
+ "microshaft wangblows" - the phattest of sumos.
+ over-abstracted oop.
+ snap.
+ religion. but, like, only if it's mixed in with nationalism/conservatism. i have no qualms with religion or.
  religious people in general, i just have some beef with mormons; mainly due to growing up very lds, in a small,
  lds community.
+ cryptocurrency. actually, money in general lmao. not the biggest fan of markets i must say. though, i'm not smart
  enough to find a good alternative in our fucked up world hehe.

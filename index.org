* huh?
yes, i stole [[http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com][that other guy's css]].

my name is elizabeth, or lizzy / liz. i'm 19, president
of the [[https://linux.usu.edu][USU FSLC]], student in computer science, and intern at AWS...
also a filthy liberal :)

sometimes, i make (what i believe to be) cool stuff. like [[https://chessh.linux.usu.edu][cheSSH]]!

** regulars be saddened, for we are no longer elixir
i used to have a kinda cool site i built a few years back, to explore [[https://www.phoenixframework.org/][phoenix]].
but i never ended up using the features i spent so
long making - a time card clock & exporter for contract use, contact form w/
captcha, dynamic blog system with comments and roles, etc. it was my first
full-stack app i made for fun, at the time; so pulling the plug was a little
bittersweet.

all you'll get here now, mostly, is black text and some of my takes.
whether they're good or bad is up to you, dear reader.

* monies
i believe salaries should be public & discussable information. to least "help"
combat corporate greed (though, we should all be being paid the same... ideally)

* things i like...
+ elixir, lisp, c, (some aspects of) javascript. i don't really know how to feel about java, but i've used it the most out of anything.
+ math - algebra of abstract or linear variety, number theory, analysis, discrete. you name it. shove it in my brain already.
+ functional paradigms.
+ emacs.
+ linux.
+ chess.
+ minecraft.
+ democratic nations that practice social ideals to better the lives of their citizens rather than capital owners.
* things i'm not so much a fan of...
+ c++ - when it's being cringe. which is unfortunately a lot of the fucking time.
+ "microshaft wangblows" - the phattest of sumos.
+ over-abstracted oop.
+ snap.
+ religion. but, like, only if it's mixed in with nationalism/conservatism. i have no qualms with religion or
  people practicing in general, i just have some beef with mormons; mainly due to growing up very lds, in a small,
  lds community.
+ just money in general lmao. not the biggest fan of markets i must say.
  there might not be a good alternative currently, which is why UBI is a good compromise of both worlds.
